# Scenario Description

This database model is designed to support core hotel operations and is crucial for tracking hotel-customer interactions. It facilitates the management of guest information, including personal details and contact information. The system also handles hotel and room management, tracking details such as hotel locations, room types, and real-time availability. Reservations are a central component, with the database storing reservation details like check-in dates, total amounts, payment status, and links to relevant hotel, guest, room, and payment information. Payment processing is also supported, with the system recording payment transactions, dates, and methods. Importantly, this structure efficiently organizes and analyzes data, revealing trends and insights into key hotel operations. By providing a foundation for managing key aspects of a hotel's business, from guest interactions and bookings to room management and financial transactions, this model enables hotels to efficiently organize and navigate data, make informed decisions, and ultimately leads to improved efficiency, increased profitability, and a better overall customer experience.
